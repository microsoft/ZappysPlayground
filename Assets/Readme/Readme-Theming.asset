    text: Theming is the ability to wholesale change the visual aesthetic of many
      UX elements at once. Typically, all of the data needed to specify a theme is
      provided by a single Data Source, such as a Scriptable Object. It is also possible
      for theming data to be provided as needed, or divided into logical groups based
      on its purpose.

  - heading: 
    text: Theming uses all of the plumbing of data sources and data consumers. It
      is possible to theme any hierarchy of GameObjects whether they are static or
      are dynamically data bound to other data sources. This allows for both data
      binding and theming to be applied in combination. It is even possible to theme
      the data coming from another data source.

  - heading: 
    text: Data Binding and Theming can co-exist for a single UX element. Any individual
      UX element can be simultaneously themed and data bound. In this scenario, the
      typical flow is that the datum coming from a DataSource is used to derive the
      correct theme keypath. This keypath is then used to retrieve an object from
      the theme Data Source, typically a ScriptableObject profile, but potentially
      any source of data that can resolve a keypath.
