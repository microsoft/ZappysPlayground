    text: The DirectionalIndicator class is a tag-along component that orients itself
      to the direction of a desired point in space.

  - heading: 
    text: Most commonly used when the Tracked Target Type of the SolverHandler is
      set to Head. In this fashion, a UX component with the DirectionalIndicator
      solver will direct a user to look at the desired point in space.

  - heading: 
    text: The desired point in space is determined via the Directional Target property.

  - heading: 
    text: If the directional target is viewable by the user or whatever frame of
      reference is set in the SolverHandler, then this solver will disable all Renderer 
      components underneath it. If not viewable, then everything will be enabled
      on the indicator.

  - heading: 
    text: The size of the indicator will shrink the closer the user is to capturing
      the Directional Target in their FOV.

      user to their next goal. Refer to the Directional Indicator prefab [Assets/MSPlayground/Turbines/Prefabs/DirectionalIndicator.prefab]
      for an example of a Directional Indicator component. The Directional Indicator\u2019s
      target is set by the Turbine Scenario Resources script file [Assets/MSPlayground/Turbines/Scripts/TurbineScenarioResources.cs]
      via the FocusOnObject() method."
