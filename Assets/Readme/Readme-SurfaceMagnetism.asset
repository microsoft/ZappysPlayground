  title: Surface Magnetism (Solver)
  sections:
  - heading: 
    text: Surface Magnetism lets you easily orient and place virtual objects on real-world
      physical surfaces, and is a useful tool to arrange objects into a fixed pattern.

    text: The SurfaceMagnetism works by performing a ray cast against a set LayerMask
      of surfaces, and placing the GameObject at that contact point.

  - heading: 
    text: The Surface Normal Offset will place the GameObject a set distance in meters
      away from the surface in the direction of the normal at the hit point on the
      surface.

  - heading: 
    text: Conversely, the Surface Ray Offset will place the GameObject a set distance
      in meters away from the surface but in the opposite direction of the ray cast
      performed. Thus, if the ray cast is the user's gaze, the GameObject will move
      closer along the line from the hit point on the surface to the camera.

  - heading: 
    text: In MSPlayground we use the Surface Magnetism Solver for placement of the
      Window (aligned to the walls) and the Windfarm (aligned to the floor). Refer
      to the Turbines Scene [Assets/MSPlayground/Turbines/Scenes/Turbines.unity]
      and open the Objects World > Windfarm and the Objects World > Window object
      in the Inspector for examples of the Surface Magnetism component configuration.
      In both cases Surface Magnetism is not enabled by default, which is done by
      script. The Window Controller [Assets/MSPlayground/Turbines/Scripts/WindowController.cs]
      and Windfarm Controller [Assets/MSPlayground/Turbines/Scripts/WindfarmController.cs]
      enable Surface Magnetism in their respective EnablePlacement() methods.
