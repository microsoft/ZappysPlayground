  title: UI Follow (Solver)
  sections:
  - heading: 
    text: UI Follow enables virtual objects and UI components to maintain their position
      with respect to the user while they move around the scene.
    linkText:

  - heading: 
    text: The Follow class positions an element in front of the tracked target relative
      to its local forward axis. The element can be loosely constrained (also known
      as tag along) so that it doesn't follow until the tracked target moves beyond
      user-defined bounds.
    linkText:

  - heading: 
    text: It works similarly to the RadialView solver, with additional controls to
      manage Max Horizontal & Vertical View Degrees and mechanisms to alter the object's
      Orientation.

  - heading: 
    text: In MSPlayground most UI panels are using the UI Follow solver. Refer to
      the panel_nc_dialog examples [Assets/MSPlayground/Common/Resources/Prefabs/UI
      Panels/panel_nc_dialog.prefab] and locate Solver Handler and Follow in the
      Inspector.

    text: "A Solver is used by adding a Solver Handler to an object which identifies
      the tracking target and is responsible for updating one or more Solvers. This
      example is configured to track the user\u2019s head."
