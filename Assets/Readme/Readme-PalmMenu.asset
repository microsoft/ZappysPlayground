  title: Hand Menu with Hand Constraint Palm Up (Solver)
  sections:
  - heading: 
    text: Hand Menus allow you to quickly bring up hand-attached UI. This UI is accessible
      anytime and can be shown and hidden easily, and is a great place for quick
      actions.

  - heading: 
    text: The HandConstraint behavior provides a solver that constrains the tracked
      object to a region safe for hand constrained content (such as hand UI, menus,
      etc.) Safe regions are considered areas that don't intersect with the hand.
      A derived class of HandConstraint called HandConstraintPalmUp is also included
      to demonstrate a common behavior of activating the solver-tracked object when
      the palm is facing the user.

  - heading: 
    text: In MSPlayground a Hand Menu is used to provide an accessible UI that is
      available from anywhere in the scene and is persistent across all scenes. In
      particular, the Turbine Repair Menu is attached to the Hand Menu. Refer to
      the Bootstrap Scene [Assets/MSPlayground/Core/Bootstrapper/BootstrapScene.unity]
      and select the Debug > CanvasHandMenu object. In the Inspector the Solver Handler
      for the menu tracks the Hand Joint and the Hand Constraint (Palm Up) Solver
      is active.

    text: "When compiling the project for a VR Device the Hand Constraint (Palm Up)
      Solver is disabled and replaced with a Follow Solver to control menu positioning,
      and the Solver Handler is changed from tracking the Hand Joint to the user\u2019s
      Head. The menu is also modified to activate when the A Button is pressed."
