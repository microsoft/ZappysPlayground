    text: In MRTK 2.x, BoundsControl was mainly runtime-generated through the use
      of configuration ScriptableObjects. In MRTK3, the setup and customization of
      BoundsControl has been significantly simplified. The bounds visuals and handles
      are simply a customizable prefab that BoundsControl instantiates at runtime.
      Developers can tweak and customize the visuals prefab, or even build new bounds
      visuals from scratch. We provide standard bounds visuals implementations, following
      the new Mixed Reality Design Language.

  - heading: 
    text: The new visuals offer streamlined visual feedback that illustrates the
      user's intent and manipulation of the object with minimally intrusive visual
      noise.

    text: In MSPlayground we use BoundsControl to control orientation of the Wind
      Turbines to face the window and increase their power. Refer to the Turbine
      prefab [Assets/Experimental/TurbineTest/Prefabs/Turbine.prefab] and locate
      the Bounds Control (Script) in the Inspector. This example limits the enabled
      handles to Rotation-only.
