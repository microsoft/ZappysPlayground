  title: Object Manipulation

  - heading: 
    text: Object Manipulator enables intuitive manipulation of objects in 3D space
      with any input device or modality. In MRTK v2, most of the complex logic and
      math for the different types of input were handled by ObjectManipulator itself.
      A separate codepath had to be maintained for each type of interaction, resulting
      in less flexibility when introducing new types of interactions. In MRTK3, the
      interactor is responsible for the specifics of how a particular type of input
      is translated into a manipulation. ObjectManipulator simply listens to these
      interactors and applies the relevant transformation to the object. As a result,
      ObjectManipulator in MRTK3 is significantly simpler and smaller in scope.

    text: In MSPlaygroud we use Object Manipulation to allow you to pick up and place
      the Wind Turbines. Refer to the Turbine prefab [Assets/Experimental/TurbineTest/Prefabs/Turbine.prefab]
      and locate the Object Manipulator (Script) in the Inspector. This example limits
      the allowed manipulations to Move-only.
