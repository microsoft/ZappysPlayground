    text: 'MSPlayground is an XR application designed to demonstrate some key MRTK3
      features in a simple game experience. It consists of two experiences: the Hub,
      and Turbines. The Hub is a launcher from which other experiences, such as Turbines,
      can be initiated. The Turbines experience is a simple game in which Zappy the
      robot has lost his power supply, and the user is tasked with helping him recover
      it.'
